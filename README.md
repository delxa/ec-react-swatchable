class Example extends Component {

  }
}

## Adding new colour spaces for conversion

The Colour service within Swatchable is designed to be easily extended. The default colour spaces are stored within `src/lib/spaces` and provide an excellent example base on which to build your own conversions.

Ostensibly, a colour space file consists of:

- an exported `toRgb()` function that takes a colour object and returns RGB array array
- an exported `fromRgb()` function that takes an RGB colour object and returns the array or string for the colourspace
- a class from which instances of the Colour in the space can be created from a Colour object and the conversion functions used.

The ColourService file exports both the classs, as well as singleton instance of the class with the default convertors preloaded.
